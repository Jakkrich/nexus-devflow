## 0. First-time setup — style guide gate

**Before generating your first diagram in a new project, verify the style guide has been customized.**

Don't silently ship default-skinned diagrams into a branded project.

First check the project root for a `.diagram-design` marker and resolve it per [`references/profiles.md`](profiles.md). A valid marker whose profile exists selects that file directly and skips this gate; `profile: default` also skips it. A malformed or missing-profile marker follows the visible failure handling in that reference. Never copy a marker-selected profile over the installed working copy.

Open [`references/style-guide.md`](style-guide.md) and check the default tokens. If they're still the shipped defaults (paper `#f5f5f5`, ink `#2d3142`, accent `#eb6c36` atomic-tangerine), **pause and ask the user**:

> *"This is your first diagram in this project. The style guide is still at the default (neutral white-smoke + atomic-tangerine). Do you want to customize it to match your brand first? Options: (a) pull from your website URL, (b) extract from an installed skill, (c) extract from a local folder / design-system directory, (d) paste tokens manually, (e) proceed with the default for now, (f) load a saved client profile."*

Then branch per the matching section of [`references/onboarding.md`](onboarding.md); for **(f)** follow [`references/profiles.md`](profiles.md).

**Once the style guide has been customized** (or the user explicitly opted for default), skip this gate on subsequent runs. A leading profile header names the copied-in active profile. Without a header, any semantic-role value or typography family differing from shipped defaults means **custom-unsaved**: skip the gate and offer to save it as a profile. All-default tokens with no marker/header trigger the gate. At the end of every onboarding method, offer to save the result as a named client profile per `references/profiles.md`.
